Your clean record is a strong mitigating factor. You should immediately consult with an attorney to attempt to negotiate a reduction to a less serious violation such as improper passing or speeding. Reckless driving requires proof of 'willful or wanton disregard,' which may be challengeable if the passing was done safely despite the zone violation. Texas also offers defensive driving courses that can help with certain violations. Act quickly to preserve your options. This is general information only and not legal advice; you should speak with a licensed attorney about your exact circumstances.",

If you passed safely without endangering anyone, you may be able to challenge whether your conduct met this standard. Request disclosure including photos of the no-passing zone markings, the officer's notes, and any dashcam footage if available. If the markings were faded or unclear, or if your passing was demonstrably safe, you may have a defence. However, passing in a no-passing zone is still a violation, and if the evidence is strong, you risk a conviction. Consider this approach if you're prepared for the uncertainty of trial.
