The officer observed the vehicle and estimated the speed at approximately 75 mph in a 65 mph zone. The officer did not use radar or laser, relying on visual estimation and pacing. The driver maintains they were driving safely for conditions. Weather was heavy rain, visibility reduced. Driver has a clean record for 5 years, holds a Class C California driver's licence.",

Since the officer used visual estimation rather than radar or laser, there may be room to challenge the accuracy. You can also request an in-person trial if you prefer. Given your clean record, the court may be willing to reduce the charge or offer traffic school to avoid points. California allows traffic school once every 18 months to mask a violation from your insurance. Consider requesting disclosure of the officer's notes and training records.

        "full_advice_text": "Visual speed estimation by officers is generally less reliable than radar or laser devices. You can challenge the officer's ability to accurately estimate speed, especially in adverse weather conditions. Request the officer's training records regarding visual speed estimation, and consider whether the pacing method (if used) was properly executed. If the officer cannot provide adequate evidence of training or if there are inconsistencies in the notes, you may have a defence. However, officers are trained in speed estimation, and courts often give weight to their testimony. If you lose, you'll face the full penalty.
