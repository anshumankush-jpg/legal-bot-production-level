If convicted at 50+ km/h over, you face significant penalties including extended impoundment, high fines, and severe insurance consequences. Your immediate priority should be to consult with a lawyer or paralegal who can attempt to negotiate a reduction to below 50 km/h over the limit. If successful, this can significantly reduce the penalties. The 7-day impoundment and suspension have already occurred, but a reduction in the charge can prevent longer-term consequences. Time is critical - act quickly to preserve your rights and explore all options. This is general information only and not legal advice; you should speak with a licensed lawyer or paralegal about your exact circumstances.",

A qualified legal professional can review whether there are any technical weaknesses in the prosecution's case. If weaknesses exist, you may have leverage for a better plea deal or grounds for a trial defence. However, laser evidence is generally reliable, and the penalties for losing at trial are severe. A strategic approach would be to review disclosure first, then decide whether to negotiate or proceed to trial based on the strength of the evidence.
