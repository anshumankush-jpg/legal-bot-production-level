        "full_advice_text": "Given you were 30 km/h over the limit with no prior record, a common practical approach in Ontario is to request an early resolution or meeting with the prosecutor. The goal is to seek a plea to a lower speed or a less serious offence that carries fewer demerit points and a smaller insurance impact. Before that meeting, obtain and review the officer's notes through disclosure. If there are no obvious technical defences and you want to minimize risk and time, a negotiated reduction is often more predictable than a full trial. This is general information only and not legal advice; you should speak with a licensed lawyer or paralegal about your exact circumstances.",

        "full_advice_text": "If you are prepared for more uncertainty and time in court, you can plead not guilty and set the matter for trial. Request full disclosure, including the officer's notes, radar manual pages, and calibration records. A paralegal or lawyer can review whether the officer was properly trained, whether the device was tested correctly, and whether there are gaps in the prosecution's evidence. If a significant weakness appears, you might obtain a withdrawal or an acquittal. However, if the evidence is strong, you could end up with a conviction close to the original speed. This is general information only and not legal advice; you should speak with a licensed lawyer or paralegal about your exact circumstances.",
