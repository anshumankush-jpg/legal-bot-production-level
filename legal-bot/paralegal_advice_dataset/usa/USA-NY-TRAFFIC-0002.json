Given your one prior violation and the circumstances, you may be able to negotiate a reduction. Request disclosure to verify that the work zone was properly marked and that workers were actually present at the time of your violation. If the work zone requirements weren't fully met, you may have grounds for a reduction. Even if the work zone was properly established, your clean record (aside from one prior) may help in negotiations. Consider requesting a plea to a non-work-zone speeding violation to avoid the double fine.
