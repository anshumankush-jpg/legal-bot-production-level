## Example 1: Criminal Law Question

### Question:
> "What is the penalty for theft in Canada?"

### BEFORE (Old System):

```
If you're charged with theft in Canada, the penalty depends on the value 
of what was stolen. For theft under $5,000, you could face up to 2 years 
in prison if it's an indictable offense, or 6 months and a fine if it's 
summary. For theft over $5,000, you could get up to 10 years in prison.

The actual sentence depends on your criminal history and other factors. 
You should talk to a lawyer if you're facing theft charges.
```

**Issues:**
- ❌ Casual tone ("you could face")
- ❌ No specific legal citations
- ❌ Vague references ("summary", "indictable")
- ❌ No structure or formatting
- ❌ Incomplete disclaimer

---

### AFTER (Professional System):

```
The penalty for theft in Canada is determined by the value of the stolen 
property and the Crown's election to proceed by summary conviction or 
indictment.

**Legal Basis:**
Under Section 334 of the Criminal Code of Canada, theft is categorized 
as follows:

1. **Theft Under $5,000** (Section 334(b)):
   - If prosecuted by indictment: Maximum 2 years imprisonment
   - If prosecuted summarily: Maximum 6 months imprisonment and/or 
     $5,000 fine

2. **Theft Over $5,000** (Section 334(a)):
   - Indictable offense only
   - Maximum penalty: 10 years imprisonment

**Additional Considerations:**
- First-time offenders may receive conditional discharge, probation, or 
  suspended sentence depending on circumstances
- Aggravating factors (breach of trust, targeting vulnerable victims) 
  can increase sentences
- Restitution to victims may be ordered
- A criminal record can result, affecting employment and travel

**Next Steps:**
If charged with theft, you should:
1. Exercise your right to remain silent except to identify yourself
2. Contact a criminal defense lawyer immediately
3. Do not discuss the case with anyone except your lawyer
4. Attend all required court appearances

This is general legal information only, not legal advice. Laws vary by 
jurisdiction and individual circumstances. For advice specific to your 
situation, please consult a licensed criminal defense lawyer in your 
jurisdiction.
```

**Improvements:**
- ✅ Professional, formal tone
- ✅ Specific legal citations (Section 334, Criminal Code of Canada)
- ✅ Clear structure with headers
- ✅ Detailed breakdown of penalties
- ✅ Additional context and considerations
- ✅ Actionable next steps
- ✅ Complete professional disclaimer

## Example 2: Traffic Law Question

### Question:
> "What happens if I get caught speeding in Ontario?"

### BEFORE (Old System):

```
If you get caught speeding in Ontario, you'll get a ticket with a fine. 
The amount depends on how fast you were going. You might also get demerit 
points on your license. If you were going really fast, like 50 km/h over 
the limit, your car could be impounded and your license suspended on the 
spot.

You can pay the ticket or fight it in court. Your insurance will probably 
go up too.
```

**Issues:**
- ❌ Informal language ("you'll get", "really fast")
- ❌ No legal citations
- ❌ Vague information ("might also get")
- ❌ No specific fine amounts or point values
- ❌ Poor organization
- ❌ No disclaimer

---

### AFTER (Professional System):

```
Speeding violations in Ontario are governed by the Highway Traffic Act.

**Legal Basis:**
Under Section 128 of the Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. H.8, 
speeding penalties are structured as follows:

**Penalties:**
1. **Fines**: Set fine schedule applies:
   - $2.50 to $9.75 per km/h over the limit
   - Specific amounts vary by speed and zone type
   - Higher fines in community safety zones

2. **Demerit Points** (Section 128):
   - 1-15 km/h over: 0 points
   - 16-29 km/h over: 3 points
   - 30-49 km/h over: 4 points
   - 50+ km/h over: 6 points

**Additional Consequences:**
- Insurance rates typically increase following a speeding conviction
- Excessive speeding (50+ km/h over) results in:
  * Immediate 7-day license suspension (Section 128.1)
  * 7-day vehicle impoundment
  * Mandatory court appearance
  * Possible additional penalties upon conviction

**Court Options:**
If you receive a speeding ticket, you have three options:
1. Pay the fine (deemed guilty, conviction registered)
2. Request early resolution meeting with prosecutor
3. Request trial to contest the charge

**Time Limits:**
- You have 15 days from the offense date to respond
- Failure to respond results in conviction and additional penalties

**Next Steps:**
1. Review the ticket for accuracy (date, time, location, speed)
2. Note the court date and location
3. Consider consulting a traffic lawyer or paralegal for:
   - Charges involving 30+ km/h over the limit
   - Multiple violations
   - Commercial drivers facing license impacts

This is general legal information only, not legal advice. For advice 
specific to your situation, please consult a licensed paralegal or 
lawyer in your jurisdiction.
```

**Improvements:**

- ✅ Specific statute citations (Section 128, Highway Traffic Act)
- ✅ Detailed penalty breakdown with exact values
- ✅ Clear structure with multiple sections
- ✅ Comprehensive consequences explained
- ✅ Procedural options outlined
- ✅ Time-sensitive information highlighted

## Example 3: Family Law Question

### Question:
> "How is child custody decided in divorce?"

### BEFORE (Old System):

```
In divorce cases, child custody is decided based on what's best for the 
child. The court looks at things like who has been the primary caregiver, 
the child's relationship with each parent, and the ability of each parent 
to provide for the child's needs.

There's physical custody (where the child lives) and legal custody (who 
makes decisions). Sometimes parents share custody, sometimes one parent 
gets sole custody. The court can also order supervised visits if there 
are safety concerns.
```

**Issues:**
- ❌ Casual explanation
- ❌ No legal citations or statutes
- ❌ Vague criteria ("things like")
- ❌ No jurisdiction specified
- ❌ No procedural information
- ❌ Missing disclaimer

---

### AFTER (Professional System):

```
Child custody determinations in divorce proceedings are governed by the 
principle of the "best interests of the child."

**Legal Framework:**

**United States:**
Most states follow the Uniform Marriage and Divorce Act guidelines, which 
establish that custody decisions must prioritize the child's best interests.

**Canada:**
The Divorce Act (Section 16) governs custody and access in divorce cases, 
recently amended to focus on "parenting arrangements" rather than 
traditional custody terminology.

**Best Interests Factors:**
Courts consider multiple factors, including:

1. **Child's Needs:**
   - Physical, emotional, and psychological needs
   - Educational and developmental requirements
   - Any special needs or circumstances

2. **Parental Capacity:**
   - Ability to meet the child's needs
   - Parenting skills and willingness to parent
   - Mental and physical health of each parent
   - History of family violence or substance abuse

3. **Child's Relationships:**
   - Quality of relationship with each parent
   - Siblings and extended family relationships
   - Continuity and stability of arrangements

4. **Practical Considerations:**
   - Each parent's living situation
   - Work schedules and availability
   - Geographic proximity
   - Child's adjustment to home, school, community

5. **Child's Views:**
   - Child's preferences (weight given based on age and maturity)
   - Generally considered for children 12+ years old

**Types of Custody:**

1. **Legal Custody:**
   - Authority to make major decisions (education, healthcare, religion)
   - Can be sole or joint

2. **Physical Custody:**
   - Where the child primarily resides
   - Can be sole, joint, or split

3. **Parenting Time/Access:**
   - Schedule for time with each parent
   - Can include regular schedule, holidays, vacations

**Court Process:**

1. **Filing:** Custody petition filed with divorce or separately
2. **Mediation:** Many jurisdictions require mediation attempt
3. **Evaluation:** Court may order custody evaluation by professional
4. **Hearing:** Evidence presented if agreement not reached
5. **Order:** Court issues custody and parenting time order

**Modification:**
Custody orders can be modified upon showing of:
- Material change in circumstances
- Continued focus on child's best interests

**Next Steps:**
If facing custody issues:
1. Document your involvement in child's life and care
2. Maintain detailed records of parenting time and communications
3. Consider mediation before litigation
4. Consult a family law attorney for jurisdiction-specific guidance
5. Prioritize child's stability and well-being throughout process

This is general legal information only, not legal advice. Family law 
varies significantly by jurisdiction. For advice specific to your 
situation, please consult a licensed family law attorney in your 
jurisdiction.

- ✅ Both US and Canadian law addressed
- ✅ Detailed factors clearly organized

- ✅ Complete court process outlined

## Example 4: With Uploaded Document

### Question:
> "What does this contract say?" (with uploaded employment contract)

### BEFORE (Old System):

```
I can see you've uploaded a document, but I can't directly view images. 
However, if you tell me what you're looking for in the contract, I can 
try to help explain common contract terms.

Employment contracts usually include things like:
- Job duties
- Salary and benefits
- Work hours
- Termination clauses
- Non-compete agreements

What specific part of the contract do you have questions about?
```

**Issues:**
- ❌ Doesn't use OCR-extracted text
- ❌ Generic response not based on actual document
- ❌ No specific analysis
- ❌ Asks user to do the work
- ❌ No legal citations or structure

---

### AFTER (Professional System):

```
Based on the uploaded employment contract, here is an analysis of the 
key terms:

**Document Analysis:**

**1. Employment Terms** (Page 1, Section 2):
The contract establishes:
- **Position:** Senior Software Developer
- **Start Date:** January 15, 2026
- **Term:** 2-year fixed term contract
- **Location:** Toronto, Ontario office with hybrid work arrangement

**2. Compensation** (Page 2, Section 3):

- **Payment Schedule:** Bi-weekly direct deposit
- **Benefits:** 
  * Extended health and dental coverage (starts after 3-month probation)
  * RRSP matching up to 5% of salary
  * 3 weeks paid vacation annually

**3. Termination Provisions** (Page 3, Section 7):

**Termination by Employer:**
- With cause: Immediate termination without notice or severance
- Without cause: 4 weeks written notice OR pay in lieu
- Note: This meets minimum Employment Standards Act, 2000 requirements 
  for Ontario

**Termination by Employee:**
- Requires 2 weeks written notice

**4. Restrictive Covenants** (Page 4, Section 9):

**Non-Competition Clause:**
- 6-month restriction post-employment
- Geographic scope: Greater Toronto Area
- Applies to direct competitors in software development sector

**Confidentiality:**
- Indefinite obligation regarding proprietary information
- Survives termination of employment

**5. Intellectual Property** (Page 4, Section 10):
- All work product created during employment belongs to employer
- Includes inventions, code, designs, documentation

**Legal Considerations:**

**Ontario Employment Law Context:**
Under the Employment Standards Act, 2000:
- Minimum notice periods apply (increases with length of service)
- Contract terms cannot provide less than statutory minimums
- Non-competition clauses must be reasonable in scope and duration

**Potential Issues to Consider:**
1. **Termination Clause:** 4 weeks notice may be insufficient depending 
   on common law reasonable notice principles
2. **Non-Competition:** 6-month restriction may be challenged if 
   unreasonable or overly broad
3. **Probation Period:** 3-month probation is standard but should be 
   clearly defined

**Recommendations:**
Before signing this contract:
1. Review termination provisions with employment lawyer
2. Clarify probationary period terms and evaluation criteria
3. Negotiate non-competition clause scope if concerns exist
4. Ensure benefits details match verbal agreements
5. Understand intellectual property implications for side projects

**Next Steps:**
1. Do not sign until you fully understand all terms
2. Consult an employment lawyer for review (recommended for all 
   employment contracts)
3. Negotiate any concerning terms before signing
4. Keep a signed copy for your records
