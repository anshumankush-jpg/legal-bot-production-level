## 💡 Example: Real Case

### Your Situation:
"My neighbor knocked down my fence with their truck and refuses to pay for repairs."

### Fill the Form Like This:

**Your Name:** John Smith  
**Your Address:** 123 Oak Street, Los Angeles, CA 90001  

**Defendant Name:** Bob Johnson  
**Defendant Address:** 125 Oak Street, Los Angeles, CA 90001  

**Legal Grounds:**
```
On December 15, 2025, my neighbor Bob Johnson backed his truck into 
my wooden fence, completely destroying a 20-foot section. 

The damage includes:
- 20 feet of wooden fence completely destroyed
- Damage to fence posts and concrete footings
- Damage to landscaping near the fence

I immediately spoke with Mr. Johnson about the damage. He acknowledged 
hitting the fence but has refused to pay for repairs. I obtained three 
repair estimates ranging from $2,500 to $3,200. I sent Mr. Johnson a 
written demand letter on December 20, 2025, but he has not responded.

This constitutes negligence and property damage under California law.
```

**Relief Sought:**
```
1. Compensatory damages of $3,200 for fence repair and replacement
2. Court costs and filing fees
3. Pre-judgment interest
4. Any other relief the Court deems just and proper
```

**Jurisdiction:** California  
**Date of Incident:** 12/15/2025  
**Damages Amount:** 3200
